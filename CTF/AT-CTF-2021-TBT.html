In this challenge May be there is XSS vulnerability but here I I injects some scripts
but it won’t woks for the flags.
  </br>
  ```
<SRC=# onmouseover="alert('theblackthreat welcome you.')">
  ```
  </br>
but it didn’t work so I look around to the source file and I found something intersting.
the function for button tag where we can inject our script.
  </br>
Page source http://164.52.211.11:9001/javas.js
  </br>
  
```
var secretCode = "X01lZWVffQ==";

document.getElementsByTagName('button').onclick=function() {
click();
}
function click() {
document.getElementById("he").innerHTML = "You Can't find me...";
}
```
</br>
<img src="uploads/2.jpg">
     </br>
So the secretCode is X01lZWVffQ==
</br>
It will looks like base64 so i decode it I got the flag
</br>
seems that the name is the flag.
</br>
<b>Result Flag: </b>
