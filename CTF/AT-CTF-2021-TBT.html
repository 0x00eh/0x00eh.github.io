<p><b>Enumeration:</b> Ths this challenge as the name says that inspect me. and is something
about inspect</p>


In this challenge May be there is XSS vulnerability but here I I injects some scripts
but it won’t woks for the flags.
<IMG SRC=# onmouseover="alert('Flag')">
but it didn’t work so I look around to the source file and I found something intersting.
the function for button tag where we can inject our script.
Page source http://164.52.211.11:9001/javas.js
```
var secretCode = "X01lZWVffQ==";
document.getElementsByTagName('button').onclick=function() {
click();
}
function click() {
document.getElementById("he").innerHTML = "You Can't find me...";
}
```
<img src=main/uploads/2.
So the secretCode is X01lZWVffQ==
It will looks like base64 so i decode it I got the flag
seems that the name is the flag.
Result Flag:
